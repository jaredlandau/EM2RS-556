# EM2RS-556

Script utilising the MinimalModbus module to control a Leadshine MOT-186 stepper motor via a Leadshine EM2RS-556 driver. Communication protocol used is Modbus RTU via an RS485 cable. May work with other Leadshine stepper motors or drivers with slight tweaks to register addresses, but this is as of yet untested.

Originally written for a research project, where this will be used to automate the tuning of an axion haloscope cavity across different frequency modes.
